# assignment-week04

Week 04 was a tough one and each time I think this week will be the week I'll go under I manage to somehow pull through finding it's always the smallest (or actually quite big and imoportant) things easily missed, understanding anything overlooked in a build can break the whole process and it's all slotting together and making more sense. Through continual debugging, for literal days, I'm glad I went through the pain because I feel so much more enlightened now and I know this is just the beginning. Hours, days and in this case, almost two weeks of research and debugging has gained me new insight in how things work and what the important things to check are before starting a project (in my case checking all node packages needed for a project are installed and running) and familiarising myself with languages, what they do / their rules / protocols, and checking along the way for errors to save time. I still find the information hard to absorb at the time with the pacing at times but I'm very good at independently working so I feel I do eventually catch up on my own. I'm hoping delays like this will become less and less as we all become more familiar with it! Problem solving is pretty fun and rewarding too...
